# surface-pro2-relife-batt-linux

I will be bringing back to life an older Microsoft Surface laptop 2. 

The humble beginnings of this project came about when I realized two things 
1. I needed a new computer that met my RAM/storage requirements
&
2. I couldn't even use my Surface without it being plugged into a power source.

So I decided to make a sleek, cyberpunk-ish theme Linux machine.
