## ðŸŽ¨ Surface Refresh: Sticker Upgrade & Cleanup

After years of use, the old Surface laptop had accumulated worn-out stickers. To give *Lazarus* a fresh new look, all stickers were carefully removed using **99% isopropyl alcohol** and patience. The surface was then cleaned and polished before applying a new set of customized decals.

Minimalist, clean, and worthy of its rebirth.
